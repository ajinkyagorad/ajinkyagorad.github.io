Make your own oscilloscope
=========================
How wonderful it is to look at signals in time and how they are used. It is the fundamental control used in vast systems, be it Neural Networks to Microprocessors, these form essential building blocks of todays world.
So we want to engineer on these signals we must have a way to look and analyse their response for the system. Thats where oscilloscopes are used. Be it fun hobby to engineering complex systems.
_So as stethoscope listens to the sounds, Oscilloscope listens at voltage signals_.
